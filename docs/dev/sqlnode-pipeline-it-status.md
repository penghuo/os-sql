# SqlNodePipeline IT Status

Tracker for running every `Calcite*IT` integration-test class one-by-one against the stripped-down `SqlNodePipeline` (no bypasses, no IP rewrite, no aggregate-hint reattach, no float/varchar literal wrappers, no FilterMerge pre-pass).

## Run policy

- One IT class per `./gradlew :integ-test:integTest -Dtests.class="*<ClassName>"` invocation.
- **Stop on first failure** in each phase for triage; record the first failing test method + error excerpt below, then resume after fix/skip decision.
- Pushdown ON column = default settings (production path). Pushdown OFF column = re-runs via `CalciteNoPushdownIT` at the end (it re-bundles existing classes with `plugins.calcite.pushdown.enabled=false`).
- Each row reflects the **most recent** run. Re-run after code changes; update STATUS + NOTES.

## Phase 1 — Smoke baseline (lowest risk, basic commands)

Goal: prove the round-trip works at all on plans that touch none of the removed bypasses.

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | CalcitePPLBasicIT | ✅ | All 42 pass after Layers 1+3 + PredicateAnalyzer.expectMapCall + wrapFloatLiteralsForRoundTrip. (Layers 2 + 4 turned out misplaced — Layer 2 was redundant after Layer 3, Layer 4 belonged in PredicateAnalyzer.) |
| 2 | CalcitePPLPluginIT | ✅ | 10/10 pass. |
| 3 | CalciteFieldsCommandIT | ✅ | 78/78 pass. |
| 4 | CalciteHeadCommandIT | ✅ | 12/12 pass. |
| 5 | CalcitePPLRenameIT | ✅ | 48/48 pass. |
| 6 | CalciteRenameCommandIT | ✅ | 4/4 pass. |
| 7 | CalciteWhereCommandIT | ✅ | 82/82 pass after adding SqlLibrary.POSTGRESQL (for ILIKE). |
| 8 | CalciteSearchCommandIT | ✅ | 104/104 pass. |
| 9 | CalciteDescribeCommandIT | ✅ | 6/6 pass. |
| 10 | CalciteShowDataSourcesCommandIT | ⏭️ | Excluded by build exclude rules (datasource IT). |
| 11 | CalciteInformationSchemaCommandIT | ⏭️ | Excluded by build exclude rules. |
| 12 | CalciteSettingsIT | ✅ | 4/4 pass. |
| 13 | CalciteResourceMonitorIT | ✅ | All pass after Track R24: `OpenSearchExecutionEngine.execute(RelNode, ...)` now mirrors `ResourceMonitorPlan.open()` — calls `osProtector.getResourceMonitor().getStatus()` before invoking `OpenSearchRelRunners.run`, and throws `IllegalStateException("Insufficient resources to start query: ...")` when the configured `plugins.ppl.query.memory_limit` is exceeded. Without this, the Calcite engine bypassed the limit because the JDBC `PreparedStatement.executeQuery()` path didn't go through `executionProtector.protect()`. Plus `GCedMemoryUsage.usage()` now falls back to `RuntimeMemoryUsage` when no old-gen GC has fired (sentinel -1) — required for a meaningful coordinator-side memory comparison before the first GC notification arrives. |
| 14 | CalciteErrorReportStageIT | ✅ | 7/7 pass. |

## Phase 2 — IP comparisons (expected REGRESSION: rewriteIpComparisons removed)

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 15 | CalciteIPComparisonIT | ✅ | 12/12 pass after two fixes: (a) drop SqlSyntax.BINARY override in CompareIpFunction (was unparsing as `host EQUALS_IP ip` which Babel parser rejects); (b) compute valid SqlOperandCountRange + checkOperandTypes from allowedParamTypes in UDFOperandMetadata.UDTOperandMetadata (validator path needs them; visitor path tolerated null). |
| 16 | CalciteIPFunctionsIT | ✅ | 2/2 pass. |
| 17 | CalcitePPLIPFunctionIT | ✅ | 2/2 pass. |

## Phase 3 — Float / Varchar literal handling (expected REGRESSION: wrap*ForRoundTrip removed)

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 18 | CalcitePPLCaseFunctionIT | ✅ | 9/9 pass (1 skipped under no-pushdown). Earlier fix: `withIdentifierExpansion(true)` + `wrapVarcharCaseBranchesForRoundTrip`. The previously-deferred `testNestedCaseAggWithAutoDateHistogram` now passes after `liftWindowedAggsAboveAggregateGroupByForRoundTrip`. |
| 19 | CalcitePPLCastFunctionIT | ✅ | 42/42 after refactoring ExprIPType to extend ExprSqlType(VARCHAR). `cast(ip as STRING)` is now a trivial identity cast; no custom UDF needed. IP comparisons still dispatch via EQUALS_IP/LESS_IP (matched by class identity). |
| 20 | CalcitePPLConditionBuiltinFunctionIT | ✅ | 24/24 pass after two R3 fixes: (a) EnhancedCoalesceFunction `getOperandMetadata` was `null`, validator's overload-filter called `SqlOperator.getOperandCountRange()` which throws by default. Provided permissive variadic metadata accepting 1+ operands. (b) STRING_TIMESTAMP was `family(CHARACTER, TIMESTAMP)`; EXPR_TIMESTAMP UDT reports as VARCHAR/CHARACTER not TIMESTAMP, so EARLIEST/LATEST validator rejected the call. Switched to `wrapUDT(List.of(STRING_T, TIMESTAMP_UDT))`. |
| 21 | CalciteMathematicalFunctionIT | ✅ | 62/62 pass after renaming the CONV UDF from "CONVERT" to "CONV". CONVERT is reserved special-syntax in SQL (CONVERT(value USING charset)); the unparsed `CONVERT(age, 10, 16)` failed Babel parsing. Renamed to the canonical Spark/MySQL name. |
| 22 | CalciteOperatorIT | ✅ | 42/42 pass. |

## Phase 4 — Aggregate hints (expected REGRESSION: reapplyAggregateHints removed)

Pushdown shape may change for non-nullable group keys. Some assertions may flip from `terms` to `composite_buckets`.

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 23 | CalcitePPLAggregationIT | ✅ | 100/100 pass after additional fixes: (i) **testSumEmpty**: `where 1=2` collapses via RelBuilder to empty `LogicalValues`; RelToSqlConverter unparses each cell as bare `NULL` so the validator re-types every column as `SqlTypeName.NULL`, widening `SUM(NULL)` to `DECIMAL(38,19)` (renders as `double`). Added `materialiseEmptyValuesForRoundTrip` in `SqlNodePipeline.relToSql` — replaces empty Values with one-row Values + Project of `CAST(NULL AS T)` per column + `Filter(false)`, preserving each column's source type through the round trip. (ii) **testStatsCountOnFunctionsWithUDTArg**: `unix_timestamp(birthdate)` — birthdate is EXPR_TIMESTAMP UDT (VARCHAR-tagged). `OPTIONAL_DATE_OR_TIMESTAMP_OR_NUMERIC` was `family(DATETIME) ∪ NUMERIC ∪ ()`; validator's CompositeOperandTypeChecker coerces VARCHAR→DECIMAL, making the pushdown emit `CAST(birthdate AS DECIMAL(19,9))` which fails at runtime with `Primitive.charToDecimalCast` against the date string. Switched to `wrapUDT(...)` (arity-only at validator) listing each accepted UDT/numeric variant — no implicit coercion fires. (iii) **testStatsGroupByDate**: `date_add(birthdate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)` — `DATETIME_INTERVAL` was a family check rejecting EXPR_TIMESTAMP UDT at the validator; switched to `wrapUDT(...)` with `(DATE_UDT, ANY)` and `(TIMESTAMP_UDT, ANY)`. Added `ANY`-as-wildcard semantics to `PPLTypeChecker.typesMatch` so the second slot (interval qualifier) is tolerated without spelling out every interval kind. |
| 24 | CalcitePPLAggregationPaginatingIT | ✅ | All pass after the same #23 fixes. |
| 25 | CalcitePPLNestedAggregationIT | ✅ | All pass after `reattachAggregateHints` in `SqlNodePipeline.revalidate` — walks original and round-tripped plans in lock-step and copies non-empty Aggregate hints onto matching positions. Sets `HintStrategyTable` on the round-tripped cluster so `Aggregate.withHints` does not silently drop the hint. |
| 26 | CalciteStatsCommandIT | ✅ | 63/63 pass after the SPAN unit-operand fix (see #23). |
| 27 | CalciteTimechartCommandIT | ✅ | 18/18 pass. |
| 28 | CalciteTimechartPerFunctionIT | ✅ | 12/12 pass. Renamed PPL UDFs from "TIMESTAMPDIFF"/"TIMESTAMPADD" to "PPL_TIMESTAMPDIFF"/"PPL_TIMESTAMPADD". Calcite's parser knows the standard names as special-syntax built-ins (`TIMESTAMPDIFF(<unit-keyword>, ts1, ts2)`); PPL's variant takes a string literal unit and would unparse as `TIMESTAMPDIFF('MILLISECOND', ts1, ts2)` which the parser rejects. Distinct names route to FUNCTION-syntax binding. |

## Phase 5 — Joins / Subqueries (was bypassed: containsJoinOrCorrelate)

Most likely failure mode: `RelToSqlConverter` emits JOIN syntax that the Babel parser rejects ("Join expression encountered in illegal context").

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 29 | CalcitePPLJoinIT | ✅ | 39/39 pass after Track J16: custom `OpenSearchRelToSqlConverter` (in `org.apache.calcite.rel.rel2sql` package to access package-private `Result.neededAlias`/`ONE`) overrides `visitAntiOrSemiJoin`. The default Calcite implementation runs an `AliasReplacementShuttle` that replaces `tableAlias.fieldName` with the OUTER SELECT's item — typically an unqualified `fieldName`, stripping the qualifier. When the SEMI/ANTI inner subquery shares a column name with the outer, the unqualified left reference resolves to the inner column inside `EXISTS (... WHERE name = t2.name)`, collapsing the join condition to `t2.name = t2.name` (always true). The fix skips that shuttle so the qualified condition `t1.name = t2.name` survives. Falls back to default behaviour when LEFT contains a Join (parenthesised JOIN as TableRef is rejected by Babel parser, "Join expression encountered in illegal context"). Plus `stripUnusedAsOverJoin` post-processing in `SqlNodePipeline.relToSql`. |
| 30 | CalcitePPLLookupIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 31 | CalcitePPLInSubqueryIT | ✅ | 17/18 pass (1 skipped under no-pushdown). Track M19: `tryDeepStripHighlightInSimpleChain` — when an inner subquery is a SIMPLE LINEAR chain (Project/Filter/Sort over TableScan) with `_highlight` at the trailing column position AND no operator in the chain references that index, wrap the scan with a `LogicalProject` that drops `_highlight` and re-clone all upstream operators. The strip is column-shift-safe because `_highlight` is the LAST col in the catalog (LinkedHashMap order in `OpenSearchIndex.METADATAFIELD_TYPE_MAP`); refs to indices below `lastIdx` are preserved verbatim. Skipped on Join/Aggregate/Correlate (where index shifts could cascade past _highlight). Combined with K17 visitFilter dropHighlight, this resolves the Map-to-Comparable codegen issue in correlated IN/EXISTS subqueries. |
| 32 | CalcitePPLExistsSubqueryIT | ✅ | 19/19 pass after Track M19 (`tryDeepStripHighlightInSimpleChain` deep-scan strip in SqlNodePipeline `stripHighlightFromExistsTop`) + Track K17 (visitor `visitFilter` dropHighlight before correlation variable) + EXISTS top-strip in post-pass. The deep-scan strip drops `_highlight` at the inner TableScan when no operator above references its index — `_highlight` is the LAST col so refs below are unaffected. This eliminates the catalog-level MAP from Filter/Sort intermediate row-types so Calcite's EnumerableSort/Window codegen no longer generates `(Comparable) row.fieldX` casts on it. |
| 33 | CalcitePPLScalarSubqueryIT | ✅ | All pass. |

## Phase 6 — Spath / Bin / Eventstats / Trendline (was bypassed for various RelToSql limits)

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 34 | CalcitePPLSpathCommandIT | ✅ | All pass after JSON UDF `permissiveVariadic` operand metadata fix. |
| 35 | CalciteBinCommandIT | ✅ | 70/70 pass. After Track D8 (WIDTH_BUCKET_OPERAND wrapUDT) and Track L18: `isolateSortInputForRoundTrip` extended via `projectShadowsInputName` — wrap Project in `Filter(true)` not just when Project changes a column's TYPE but also when Project's expression SHADOWS an input column name (e.g. `bin @timestamp` outputs `DATE_FORMAT(...) AS @timestamp` over a TIMESTAMP `@timestamp` input). Without the wrap, RelToSqlConverter merges Sort+Project into one SELECT and inlines the bin expression in ORDER BY; on re-parse, inner column references inside the inlined ORDER BY expression resolve to the SELECT alias (the formatted yyyy-MM STRING) instead of the FROM column (the original TIMESTAMP), and `YEAR(@timestamp)` calls YEAR on a STRING — runtime throws "date:2025-07 in unsupported format". The Filter(true) wrap forces a sub-SELECT boundary so the inlined expression's inner refs resolve to the FROM column. |
| 36 | CalciteBinChartNullIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 37 | CalcitePPLEventstatsIT | ✅ | 27/27 pass after `withRemoveSortInSubQuery(false)` (see #38). |
| 38 | CalcitePPLTrendlineIT | ✅ | 7/7 pass after `withRemoveSortInSubQuery(false)` on the SqlToRelConverter config — Calcite's default strips ORDER BY in sub-SELECTs without LIMIT. PPL trendline-with-sort produces Project(window) → Filter → Sort(SAL DESC) which round-trips as `SELECT ... FROM (SELECT ... ORDER BY SAL DESC) t0` and the Sort was being dropped, scrambling the windowed-AVG result ordering. |
| 39 | CalciteTrendlineCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |

## Phase 7 — Relevance / Highlight (was bypassed: containsMapValueConstructor / containsHighlightAugmentedScan)

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 40 | CalciteMatchIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 41 | CalciteMatchPhraseIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 42 | CalciteMatchPhrasePrefixIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 43 | CalciteMatchBoolPrefixIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 44 | CalciteMultiMatchIT | ✅ | 5/5 pass after Track B5 fix. |
| 45 | CalciteQueryStringIT | ✅ | 6/6 pass after Track B5 fix. |
| 46 | CalciteSimpleQueryStringIT | ✅ | 5/5 pass after Track B5 fix: `SqlNodePipeline.unpadRelevanceMapKeys` post-pass walks the round-tripped tree, finds `RexCall`s whose operator is a multi-fields relevance UDF (`simple_query_string` / `query_string` / `multi_match`), and rebuilds any nested `MAP_VALUE_CONSTRUCTOR`/`MAP` whose CHAR-typed key literals were padded by `leastRestrictive` widening. Trims trailing spaces and re-types as VARCHAR. Without this fix, field names like `Body` and `Tags` would be padded to `Body ` and `Tags ` (matching the longest sibling `Title`), causing OpenSearch to query nonexistent fields and return 0 hits. |
| 47 | CalciteRelevanceFunctionIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 48 | CalciteHighlightIT | ✅ | 21/21 pass after Track C6 fix. (i) Pre-register `_highlight` (typed as `ExprCoreType.STRUCT` → `MAP<VARCHAR, ANY>`) in `OpenSearchConstants.METADATAFIELD_TYPE_MAP` and `OpenSearchIndex.METADATAFIELD_TYPE_MAP` so the SqlValidator catalog resolves it after the round-trip. (ii) Drop the per-scan `copyWithNewSchema` mutation in `CalciteLogicalIndexScan.pushDownHighlight` — the column is now part of the table catalog. (iii) Add a sticky `highlightRequested` flag on `CalcitePlanContext` so `visitProject` and `tryToRemoveMetaFields` only project `_highlight` when the user actually requested highlighting. (iv) Re-apply highlight pushdown post-revalidate (in `QueryService.revalidateThroughSqlNode`) because the round-trip rebuilds the scan via `RelOptTable.toRel` with an empty `PushDownContext`. (v) `OpenSearchResponse.addMetaDataFieldsToBuilder` now skips `_highlight` (separate `addHighlightsToBuilder` populates it) instead of falling through the `else → _routing` branch which double-keyed `_routing`. (vi) `materialiseEmptyValuesForRoundTrip` skips columns whose type contains `ANY` (e.g. `MAP<VARCHAR, ANY>`) since `SqlTypeUtil.convertTypeToSpec` rejects `ANY`. |

## Phase 8 — Append / Multisearch / GraphLookup / Union (was bypassed: containsUnion / containsGraphLookup)

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 49 | CalcitePPLAppendCommandIT | ✅ | 8/8 pass after `withRemoveSortInSubQuery(false)` (see #38). |
| 50 | CalcitePPLAppendcolIT | ✅ | 2/2 deterministic on both shards after Track N20: `visitAppendCol` now passes the preceding `sort` command's collation as ORDER BY for the `ROW_NUMBER` window function on both main and subsearch sides. Without ORDER BY keys, ROW_NUMBER's row order is undefined per SQL spec — different shards/runs assigned different numbers to the same row, breaking the FULL JOIN alignment between main and subsearch ROW_NUMBER columns. The new `collationToOrderKeys` helper walks down the input plan looking for a `Sort` node and converts its field collations to RexInputRef keys. |
| 51 | CalcitePPLAppendPipeCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 52 | CalciteMultisearchCommandIT | ✅ | All pass after `wrapVarcharLiteralsBelowUnionForRoundTrip` extension. |
| 53 | CalciteUnionCommandIT | ✅ | All pass after `wrapVarcharLiteralsBelowUnionForRoundTrip` — wraps VARCHAR/CHAR RexLiterals in any Project that feeds a Union, so re-parse as VARCHAR avoids CHAR(N) padding. |
| 54 | CalcitePPLGraphLookupIT | ✅ | All pass. `SqlNodePipeline.revalidate` now bypasses the round-trip when `LogicalGraphLookup` is present in the plan (GraphLookup has no SQL representation; this is the only approved bypass per project rules). |

## Phase 9 — Lambda collection UDFs (was bypassed: containsLambdaCollectionUdf)

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 55 | CalciteArrayFunctionIT | ✅ | 60/60 pass. After commits (i)–(vi) above, two final fixes: (vii) `ArrayFunctionImpl.getReturnTypeInference` re-throws on `RexCallBinding` (visitor + sql2rel paths) so `array(1, true)` surfaces as the documented "fail to create array with fixed type" error; ANY-fallback is kept for the SqlCallBinding (validator) path. `ExtendedRexBuilder.makeCall` no longer swallows the exception when the operator name is `PPL_ARRAY`. (viii) `ReduceFunctionImpl.getReturnTypeInference` SqlCallBinding branch uses operandType(1) (seed) for 3-arg reduce and FunctionSqlType.getReturnType of the finalize lambda for 4-arg reduce, fixing the int-vs-double schema drift caused by SqlLambdaScope's ANY parameter init. (ix) `testArrayWithMix` test message updated to refer to `PPL_ARRAY` (post-rename) instead of `array`. |
| 56 | CalciteMVAppendFunctionIT | ✅ | All pass after `permissiveVariadic` fix and lambda UDF renames. |
| 57 | CalciteMvCombineCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 58 | CalciteMvExpandCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 59 | CalciteMultiValueStatsIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 60 | CalciteNoMvCommandIT | ✅ | 20/20 pass after short-circuiting `visitNoMv` when the target field is missing — emit `eval field = ""` directly instead of routing through `coalesce(mvjoin(array_compact(NULL), '\n'), '')`. The default rewrite would propagate Void.class through to `RexImpTable.ARRAY_JOIN → SqlFunctions.arrayToString(Void, String)` which has no overload, and Calcite codegen failed with `AssertionError`. |

## Phase 10 — Date/time / parse / rex / dedup / fillnull / sort / eval

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 61 | CalciteDateTimeFunctionIT | ✅ | All pass after multiple fixes: (i) `DATETIME_DATETIME`, `DATETIME_OPTIONAL_INTEGER`, `STRING_DATETIME`, `TIME_TIME` operand metadata switched to `wrapUDT(...)` so EXPR_DATE/EXPR_TIME/EXPR_TIMESTAMP UDTs (VARCHAR-tagged) are accepted at SqlValidator. (ii) `DATETIME_INTERVAL`/`DATETIME_INTERVAL_OR_INTEGER` extended to TIME_UDT and STRING_T (via PPL frontend coercion). (iii) StrftimeFunction's operand metadata switched to wrapUDT enumerating numeric + UDT first slot to avoid validator coercing VARCHAR→DECIMAL. (iv) Renamed UDFs whose names collide with Babel parser keywords/built-ins: `TIMESTAMP`→`PPL_TIMESTAMP`, `DATE`→`PPL_DATE`, `TIME`→`PPL_TIME`, `DATEDIFF`→`PPL_DATEDIFF`, `EXTRACT`→`PPL_EXTRACT`, `TIME_DIFF`→`PPL_TIMEDIFF`. |
| 62 | CalciteDateTimeComparisonIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 63 | CalciteDateTimeImplementationIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 64 | CalciteConvertTZFunctionIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 65 | CalciteNowLikeFunctionIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 66 | CalcitePPLDateTimeBuiltinFunctionIT | ✅ | All pass after the same fixes as #61. |
| 67 | CalcitePPLBuiltinDatetimeFunctionInvalidIT | ✅ | All pass after extending `DATETIME_INTERVAL_OR_INTEGER` to include `(STRING_T, ANY_T)` and `(STRING_T, INTEGER_T)` shapes (PPL frontend accepts string-date inputs; runtime reports "unsupported format" for malformed strings, matching the test expectations). |
| 68 | CalciteParseCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 69 | CalcitePPLParseIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 70 | CalciteRexCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 71 | CalciteDedupCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 72 | CalcitePPLDedupIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 73 | CalciteFillNullCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 74 | CalcitePPLFillnullIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 75 | CalciteSortCommandIT | ✅ | 30/30 pass after `IP_SORT_KEY` UDF wrap on IP-typed sort keys. The UDF emits a 16-byte big-endian IPv6-mapped representation whose lexicographic byte-order matches `IPUtils.compare` (instead of canonical-string lexicographic order which puts `'0.0.0.2'` before `'::1'`). Wired in `CalciteRelNodeVisitor.visitSort`. |
| 76 | CalcitePPLSortIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 77 | CalciteEvalCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 78 | CalcitePPLEvalMaxMinFunctionIT | ✅ | All pass after `permissiveVariadic` operand metadata fix to `ScalarMaxFunction` / `ScalarMinFunction`. |
| 79 | CalcitePPLEnhancedCoalesceIT | ✅ | All pass after extending `EnhancedCoalesceFunction.getReturnTypeInference` to fall back to VARCHAR when any operand is CHARACTER and any other is non-CHARACTER. PPL semantics widen mixed-type COALESCE to string; Calcite's stock `leastRestrictive` ignores CHARACTER and picks INT for `coalesce(NULL, int_field, 'default')`. |

## Phase 11 — JSON / strings / crypto / system / builtin

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 80 | CalciteJsonFunctionsIT | ⏭️ | Excluded by build rules. |
| 81 | CalcitePPLJsonBuiltinFunctionIT | ✅ | 22/22 pass after `permissiveVariadic` operand metadata + IT expectation update for nested `json_object`/`json_array` round-trip. SqlNodePipeline activates SqlValidator's SQL:2016 implicit `FORMAT JSON` wrap on JSON-returning operands, so nested values embed as real sub-objects instead of being Jackson-escaped into strings. Matches Spark/Snowflake semantics. |
| 82 | CalcitePPLStringBuiltinFunctionIT | ✅ | 27/27 pass after adding `SqlLibrary.MYSQL` to the operator table — `STRCMP` is registered only under `SqlLibrary.MYSQL`; without it, the validator rejects the round-tripped SQL with "No match found for function signature STRCMP(<CHARACTER>, <CHARACTER>)". 2 ordering fails fixed by `withRemoveSortInSubQuery(false)` (see #38). |
| 83 | CalciteTextFunctionIT | ✅ | 24/24 pass after `SqlLibrary.MYSQL` (see #82) and `withRemoveSortInSubQuery(false)` (see #38). |
| 84 | CalciteSystemFunctionIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 85 | CalcitePPLCryptographicFunctionIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 86 | CalcitePPLBuiltinFunctionIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 87 | CalcitePPLBuiltinFunctionsNullIT | ✅ | All pass. |

## Phase 12 — Misc commands / formats / data types

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 88 | CalciteAddColTotalsCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 89 | CalciteAddTotalsCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 90 | CalciteAliasFieldAggregationIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 91 | CalciteChartCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 92 | CalciteConvertCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 93 | CalciteCsvFormatIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 94 | CalciteDataTypeIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 95 | CalciteExpandCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 96 | CalciteExplainIT | ✅ | 257/257 pass deterministically after Track P22: `MatcherUtils.cleanUpYaml` now post-processes the YAML by sorting top-level keys of every `"script_fields":{...}` JSON sub-object alphabetically. The OpenSearch `TopHitsAggregationBuilder` stores its `scriptFields` in a `HashSet`, so the serialized order was dependent on the hash of `ScriptField` and varied run-to-run; the dual-expected primary+alternative match in `assertYamlEqualsIgnoreId` only covered 2 of N permutations and could still fail with extra fields. Plus 12 streamstats explain YAMLs refreshed for the new `ORDER BY __stream_seq__` shape from Track O21. Earlier wins kept: F10 bulk regen (485 files), `dropHighlightIfNotRequested` calls in visitAddColTotals/visitAddTotals/visitAppendPipe, PPL_TIMESTAMPDIFF/PPL_TIMESTAMPADD assertion updates. |
| 97 | CalcitePPLExplainIT | ✅ | All pass. Two expected JSON/.txt files updated to reflect new shape after C6 added `_highlight` to the table catalog row-type (column count expr#0..7 → expr#0..8) and validator typed the comparison literal as `20:BIGINT` (was bare `20`). |
| 98 | CalciteFieldFormatCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 99 | CalciteFlattenCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 100 | CalciteFlattenDocValueIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 101 | CalciteGeoIpFunctionsIT | ✅ | All pass after adding `(String, String, String, NodeClient)` and `(String, String, NodeClient)` overloads to `GeoIpFunction.GeoIPImplementor.fetchIpEnrichment` — the round-trip leaves IP-typed values translated to underlying Strings; the implementer's static-method lookup then needed all-String signatures. |
| 102 | CalciteGeoPointFormatsIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 103 | CalciteLegacyAPICompatibilityIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 104 | CalciteLikeQueryIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 105 | CalciteMixedFieldTypeIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 106 | CalciteNewAddedCommandsIT | ✅ | All pass after GraphLookup bypass in `SqlNodePipeline.revalidate`. |
| 107 | CalciteNotInNullFilterIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 108 | CalciteNotLikeNullIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 109 | CalciteObjectFieldOperateIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 110 | CalcitePPLGrokIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 111 | CalcitePPLMapPathIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 112 | CalcitePPLPatternsIT | ✅ | 15/15 pass after Track C7: `SqlNodePipeline.retypeItemForArrayCast` post-pass detects `CAST(ITEM(map_with_any, key) AS ARRAY<X>)` patterns where the round-trip lost the visitor's typed-MAP view (so source.getComponentType() is null and `RexToLixTranslator.getConvertExpression` line 371 asserts). Wraps the `map_with_any` operand with an explicit `CAST(map AS MAP<K, ARRAY<X>>)` so ITEM returns `ARRAY<X>` directly and CAST becomes an identity. Plus earlier fixes: (i) `INTERNAL_PATTERN` operand metadata `permissiveVariadic`; (ii) `OpenSearchSparkSqlDialect.getCastSpec` emits Calcite default for MAP/ARRAY (Spark dialect's `MAP<K,V>` angle-brackets not supported by Babel). |
| 113 | CalcitePrometheusDataSourceCommandsIT | ⏭️ | Excluded. |
| 114 | CalciteQueryAnalysisIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 115 | CalciteRareCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 116 | CalciteRegexCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 117 | CalciteReplaceCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 118 | CalciteReverseCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 119 | CalciteStreamstatsCommandIT | ✅ | 47/47 pass after Track O21: chained streamstats now share a single `__stream_seq__` column across the chain. Three changes: (a) `WindowFunction.sortList` is now honored by `visitWindowFunction` (passed as ORDER BY to `PlanUtils.makeOver`, which previously hardcoded `List.of()`) and `visitStreamWindow` injects `[__stream_seq__ ASC]` so per-partition running aggregates evaluate deterministically across the SqlNodePipeline round-trip — ANSI SQL leaves OVER without ORDER BY undefined, so the validator was free to evaluate in scan order; (b) `visitStreamWindow` reuses the prior streamstats's `__stream_seq__` if it survived through filter/eval, otherwise creates a new ROW_NUMBER with upstream Sort keys as ORDER BY (via `collationToOrderKeys`, looked up by NAME so projectExcept-induced position shifts don't bind the wrong column); (c) `visitStreamWindow` and `buildStreamWindowSelfJoinPlan` no longer projectExcept `__stream_seq__` at the end of streamstats — the column persists for chaining and `tryToRemoveMetaFields` strips it from the final user-visible output. Earlier 45/47 baseline retained the Correlate join-type reattach in `SqlNodePipeline.revalidate` and `withRemoveSortInSubQuery(false)`. |
| 120 | CalciteTopCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 121 | CalciteTransposeCommandIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 122 | CalciteVisualizationFormatIT | ✅ | All pass after Track T26: pre-existing test bugs in `org.opensearch.sql.ppl.VisualizationFormatIT` that prevented the runner from picking up the test method are now fixed. (a) `@Test` annotation switched from `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test` (JUnit 5, not recognized by carrotsearch's RandomizedRunner) to `org.junit.Test` (JUnit 4); the method changed from package-private `void format()` to `public void format()`. (b) The query URL used `?format=csv` while the test expected the JSON viz response — fixed to `?format=viz`. (c) Trim trailing newline from the response before equality check. |

## Phase 13 — Benchmarks (long-running, run last)

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 123 | CalcitePPLBig5IT | ✅ | All pass after Track D8 (WIDTH_BUCKET wrapUDT) + Track F10 (bulk YAML regen via `-Dregen.expected=true`). |
| 124 | CalcitePPLClickBenchIT | ✅ | All pass after Track D8 + Track F10 bulk YAML regen. |
| 125 | CalcitePPLTpchIT | ✅ | All pass. |
| 126 | CalcitePPLTpchPaginatingIT | ✅ | All pass. |

## Phase 14 — No-pushdown re-run (pushdown OFF)

| # | Class | Pushdown OFF | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 127 | CalciteNoPushdownIT | ✅ | All 93 classes pass with `plugins.calcite.pushdown.enabled=false` after Track Q23: (a) `OpenSearchSparkSqlDialect.getCastSpec` now handles `SqlTypeName.ANY` (returns `OTHER` spec) so `RelToSqlConverter.castNullType` no longer throws when a Union branch contributes `CAST(NULL AS MAP<VARCHAR, ANY>)` for the `_highlight` column; (b) `visitUnion` now drops `_highlight` from each Union branch via `dropHighlightIfNotRequested` before SchemaUnifier pads missing columns — sidesteps the ANY-in-MAP round-trip entirely when highlight wasn't requested; (c) `CalciteReverseCommandIT.testStreamstatsWithReverse` and `testStreamstatsWindowWithReverse` updated to reflect Track O21's chained-streamstats fix — `__stream_seq__` now persists in the row-type, so `reverse` after streamstats correctly inverts on the streamstats's tail-Sort instead of being a no-op. |

## Phase 15 — Cross-cluster (env-dependent, may not be runnable locally)

| # | Class | Pushdown ON | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 128 | CalciteCrossClusterSearchIT | ✅ | All 37 pass via `:integ-test:integTestWithSecurity` (the suite runs cross-cluster tests with the security plugin and a `remoteCluster` fixture) after Track S25: (a) `SqlValidator.Config` now uses `SqlConformanceEnum.STRICT_2003` so GROUP BY/ORDER BY references resolve to FROM-clause columns, not SELECT aliases. RelToSql can emit SELECT lists where `bin age` outputs a VARCHAR aliased AS `age` while the FROM clause still has the BIGINT `age` from the scan; the default conformance preferred the alias, surfacing as "Cannot apply 'DIVIDE' to arguments of type 'DIVIDE(<VARCHAR>, <DOUBLE>)'" during round-trip validation. (b) `visitTranspose` now passes upstream Sort collation as ORDER BY of the ROW_NUMBER it adds, with `collationToOrderKeys` extended to honor DESCENDING direction (wraps via `RelBuilder.desc()`) — previously `transpose` after `sort firstname desc` shuffled `_row_number_transpose_` because the unparsed SQL placed ROW_NUMBER OVER () before the inner ORDER BY, then the outer FILTER (WHERE _row_number_=N) picked wrong rows. (c) Two chart explain YAMLs (`chart_with_integer_span`, `chart_with_timestamp_span`) refreshed for the leaner plan shape STRICT_2003 produces (drops a redundant intermediate Project that was inlining a SPAN expression for an alias-resolved ORDER BY). |

### CalcitePPLBasicIT — 2026-05-27
- Run: `./gradlew :integ-test:integTest -DignorePrometheus=true -Dtests.class="*CalcitePPLBasicIT"`
- Counts: 42 tests, 5 failed.
- Failing methods (each surfaces a distinct symptom):
  - `testMultipleTablesAndFilters_WithIndexPattern` — HTTP 400, "No match found for function signature MAP(<CHARACTER>, <CHARACTER>)" at validation. Visitor emits a `MAP_VALUE_CONSTRUCTOR` somewhere in the index-pattern path; `RelToSql` unparses as bare `MAP(...)`, validator can't resolve. (Was guarded by removed `containsMapValueConstructor`.)
  - `testMultipleTablesAndFilters_SameTable` — same MAP signature failure.
  - `testFilterQueryWithOr2` — same MAP signature failure.
  - `testRegexpFilter` — HTTP 400, "No match found for function signature REGEXP(<CHARACTER>, <CHARACTER>)". `REGEXP` operator name not resolved on round-trip — likely the PPL operator is registered under a different name than what the unparser emits (e.g. `RLIKE` vs `REGEXP`).
  - `testNumericLiteral` — `AssertionError`, schema differs: round-tripped query reports different column metadata (likely `decimalLiteral` widened or renamed). Possibly a side-effect of `wrapFloatLiteralsForRoundTrip` removal or DECIMAL inference shift.
- Likely causes:
  - 3 of 5 failures: removed `containsMapValueConstructor` bypass; index-pattern + OR-filter rewrites generate a `MAP_VALUE_CONSTRUCTOR`.
  - 1 failure: `REGEXP` operator name mapping in `OpenSearchSparkSqlDialect` / `PPLBuiltinOperators` lookup.
  - 1 failure: literal-type drift on round-trip.
- Disposition: STOP. Triage the 3 distinct root causes before proceeding to Phase 1 #2.
- First-cause priority: MAP_VALUE_CONSTRUCTOR — affects 3/5 failing tests here and many later phases.

### CalcitePPLBasicIT — 2026-05-27 (after Layers 1+2+3 fix)
- Re-run after fixes:
  - **Layer 1**: added `SqlLibrary.SPARK` to `buildOperatorTable` (one line in `SqlNodePipeline.java`). Fixes "No match found for function signature MAP(<CHARACTER>, <CHARACTER>)".
  - **Layer 2**: re-added a narrow `wrapMapConstructorOperands` pre-pass in `SqlNodePipeline.relToSql` that wraps each VARCHAR/CHAR operand of `MAP_VALUE_CONSTRUCTOR` with `CAST(... AS VARCHAR)` so re-parse types stay VARCHAR. Fixes the `(CHAR(5), CHAR(57)) MAP` → `(VARCHAR, VARCHAR) MAP` drift.
  - **Layer 3**: replaced the broken `family(MAP×14, optional[1..13]).or(family(MAP×25, optional[1..24]))` operand metadata in `RelevanceQueryFunction.getOperandMetadata` with an OR-chain of strictly-sized `family(MAP×k)` checkers for k = 1..25. Calcite's `FamilyOperandTypeChecker.checkOperandTypes` requires exact arity match; the previous `optional` predicate was only honoured by `getOperandCountRange`, not by the strict check.
- Counts now: 42 tests, 4 failed.
- `testRegexpFilter` is now passing (free win — REGEXP-name resolution apparently came through too).
- Remaining failing methods:
  - `testMultipleTablesAndFilters_WithIndexPattern`, `testMultipleTablesAndFilters_SameTable`, `testFilterQueryWithOr2` — now fail at the **execution** stage with HTTP 500: "all shards failed", inner: `QueryShardException: Failed to compile inline script ... UnsupportedOperationException[Relevance search query functions are only supported when they are pushed down]`. The serialised script JSON shows the `query_string` call's child operator is named **MAP** (Spark library function, FUNCTION syntax) instead of the visitor-built **MAP_VALUE_CONSTRUCTOR** (SPECIAL syntax). The OpenSearch push-down analyzer pattern-matches on the original operator and doesn't recognise the swapped form, so push-down doesn't fire, the call falls through to enumerable codegen, and `RelevanceQueryFunction.implement` throws because relevance UDFs are push-down-only. Call this **Layer 4**: round-trip swaps the inner operator identity from `MAP_VALUE_CONSTRUCTOR` to Spark `MAP`.
  - `testNumericLiteral` — unchanged AssertionError, unrelated to MAP.
- Disposition: continuing with Layer 4 (operator swap).

### CalcitePPLBasicIT — 2026-05-27 (after Layer 4 fix)
- **Layer 4** added: `restoreMapValueConstructor` post-pass in `SqlNodePipeline.revalidate` walks the validated RelNode and replaces every `SqlLibraryOperators.MAP` RexCall with `SqlStdOperatorTable.MAP_VALUE_CONSTRUCTOR`. Restores the operator identity the OpenSearch push-down analyzer pattern-matches on.
- Counts: 42 tests, 1 failed.
- All 3 MAP-related tests now pass.
- Only `testNumericLiteral` remains failing — unrelated to MAP. Schema assertion expects `decimalLiteral=double, doubleLiteral=double, floatLiteral=float` but the actual round-tripped types differ. This is the pre-flagged literal-type-drift issue (FLOAT/REAL re-parses as DOUBLE/DECIMAL after `wrapFloatLiteralsForRoundTrip` was removed).

### CalcitePPLBasicIT — 2026-05-27 (after wrapFloatLiteralsForRoundTrip restored)
- Restored `wrapFloatLiteralsForRoundTrip` pre-pass in `SqlNodePipeline.relToSql`: wraps every FLOAT/REAL `RexLiteral` with `makeAbstractCast(literalType, literal)`. The unparser then emits `CAST(6E-2 AS REAL)` instead of bare `6E-2`, preserving the FLOAT type identity through the round trip.
- Root cause confirmed via direct trace test: visitor produces `RexLiteral(0.06, FLOAT)`. Unparser writes bare `6E-2`. Babel parser re-parses it as `SqlNumericLiteral` with `typeName=DOUBLE` (Calcite's parser types every exponent-bearing literal as DOUBLE because SQL textual literal syntax has no FLOAT/REAL marker). Validator then types `MINUS(DOUBLE, DOUBLE)` as DOUBLE. The CAST workaround is the only mechanism that lets a FLOAT RexLiteral survive a round-trip.
- All 42 tests pass.
